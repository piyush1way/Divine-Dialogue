1. WHAT PROBLEM ARE YOU SOLVING? (200 words or less)
================================================================================

Millions of people face spiritual questions, mental health challenges, and 
existential crises but lack access to personalized guidance. Traditional 
solutions are fragmented: spiritual teachers are inaccessible, religious texts 
are overwhelming (thousands of verses), and generic advice doesn't address 
individual situations.

Key problems:
- Students face depression/anxiety but can't afford therapy or spiritual 
  counseling
- People want wisdom from multiple traditions but don't know where to start
- Sacred texts contain 4,903+ verses—finding relevant guidance is nearly 
  impossible
- Generic spiritual advice doesn't account for personal context (academic 
  pressure, family expectations, career struggles)
- Single-perspective guidance misses universal truths across traditions

Our problem: How do we provide authentic, personalized, multi-perspective 
spiritual guidance that's accessible, fast, and grounded in real teachings?

The impact: Mental health crisis (1 in 4 people affected), spiritual 
disconnection, lack of accessible wisdom-based counseling. We're solving the 
gap between ancient wisdom and modern accessibility.

================================================================================

Divine Dialogue is a multi-agent AI system that provides personalized 
spiritual guidance from three AI mentors (Krishna, Buddha, Jesus) in a 
coordinated dialogue.

HOW IT WORKS:

1. User enters question + personal background (e.g., "M.Tech student at IIT 
   struggling with anxiety")

2. RAG System searches 4,903 authentic verses from sacred texts (Bhagavad 
   Gita, Dhammapada, Gospels) using semantic search

3. Three AI mentors respond sequentially:
   - Krishna speaks first 
   - Buddha builds on it 
   - Jesus adds love/faith perspective
   - Each cites real verses with similarity scores

4. Moderator synthesizes all three into a personalized action plan:
   - TODAY actions (immediate steps)
   - THIS WEEK habits
   - ONGOING practices
   - Crisis techniques for when overwhelmed

KEY INNOVATIONS:

 Multi-agent orchestration (not just RAG) - mentors coordinate, not compete
 Authentic citations - real verses, not AI-generated
 Personalization - user background shapes all responses
 Voice input - accessible for all users
 Fast (10-15 seconds) - Groq API enables real-time responses
 Free - uses free-tier APIs (Groq, FAISS, Web Speech API)

TECH STACK: LangGraph (orchestration) + FAISS (RAG) + Groq LLM + Streamlit 
(UI) + Web Speech API (voice)

RESULT: Accessible, personalized, multi-perspective spiritual guidance in 
seconds, grounded in authentic teachings from three major traditions.
